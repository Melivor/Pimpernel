# Pimpernel
Pimpernel is a software that allows you to visualize mathematical parametric functions and decorate them 
## Installer 
If you want to test it out and you don't have software skill, you can download a windows installer in the installer folder (surprisingly). 
You are likely to get a Windows warning (Windows protected your PC blablabla...) because I am not a verify distributor (obviously). You should have the option to run the installer anyway somewhere.
The application take approximatively 130Mo.
## Source code 
The software is coded using Qt 5 (with QML and C++). You are very welcome to open the project in Qt Creator (open the file Pimpernel.pro) and start play with it. You will need the submodule in order to make it work. It can be achieve with the following git command :
+ git clone https://github.com/Melivor/Pimpernel
+ git submodule init
+ git submodule update
